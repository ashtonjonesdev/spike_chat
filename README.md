# 🏐 SpikeChat

<p align="center"><img src="./gif/spikechat_demo.gif"></p>

-------
A fully functional chat application built with Flutter and Stream!
* ✅  Join the chat room (If you have the secret passcode hehe)
* ✅  Send text, images, audio, and video in the chat
* ✅  React to messages (i.e. *heart react*) and see the reaction count
* ✅  See when the chat was last active

## 🚀 Motivation
I found out about Stream's chat API and wanted to experiment with it. I decided to build a Spikeball group chat application for me and my friends to plan times to play Spikeball.
